    "Our group has decided to analyze a dataset containing various categorical and numerical facts about individuals (education, income, and credit score being pertinent to this project), classifying the credit score categorically as either \"Low\" \"Average\" or \"High\". An individual's credit score describes their \"creditworthiness\", i.e their ability and trustworthiness to repay their debts. Therefore one can reason that a high credit score demonstrates a high \"creditworthiness\". Credit scores can be numerically represented, (and often are), but for the simplicity of this project, we have decided to classify credit scores between three categorical variables, (low, average, and high). If one wishes to consider these categories numerically, we consider a low credit score to be approximately 300, a high credit score to be around 800, and an average credit score to be around 550 (Investopedia, 2023). Given this information, we formulate the question: \"What is a credit score of an individual classified as, when considering their income and education?\". The specific data set that will be used to answer this question is titled \"Credit Score Classification Dataset\" and is provided by Sujith K. Mandala on Kaggle ([here is a direct link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/credit-score-classification-dataset/data)). "
